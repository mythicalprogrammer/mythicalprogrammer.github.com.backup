Hi, my name is Anthony Doan. This is my professional and personal blog, as always the opinions are solely mine and I am responsible for so.

Just a grad student for the time being, hopeful data science/statistician after graduation.

Graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science during the recession, I worked for well over a decade as a programmer. I decided to go back to graduated school for a Master in Applied Statistic.
